            <h2>Spiders, and other creatures</h2>

            <p>Spiders live among us in almost every conceivable habitat. Their ecological role, one that benefits us, is as the ultimate predators of insects. They pursue this role with instinctive dedication; some have even moved into the warm micro-climates of people’s homes, unwittingly protecting us from pesky insects. In turn, they are a food source for many animals, forming an important link in the food chain.

                Evolution has equipped spiders with a myriad of techniques for capturing insect prey: jumping spiders leap, crab spiders ambush, wolf spiders give chase and web-weaving spiders entrap. The earliest spider fossils date back 300 million years, and the creatures probably developed at least 100 million years before that, during the Devonian period. No other group of animals has been hunting insects so efficiently for so long.
                
                Although feared by many, Ontario spiders are generally not dangerous and hardly ever bite humans. Most spiders use venom, delivered from an opening in their chelicerae (jaws), to subdue and predigest prey. In Ontario, however, only the rare and shy northern widow spider (Lactrodectus variolus) is considered dangerous to people. Even from this species, a bite is very unlikely to be fatal.
                
                Both insects and spiders are arthropods (invertebrates with jointed legs). Insects form one class of arthropods, while spiders are an order – a level that is subordinate to a class – of arachnids. Other arachnids include harvestmen (daddy-long-legs), scorpions, ticks and mites. Spiders differ from insects in having eight rather than six legs, simple rather than compound eyes, two main body parts (abdomen and cephalothorax – a fused head and thorax) instead of three, no antennae and, of course, no wings.
                
                In Ontario, the best time for observing spiders is from late spring to early fall. Early morning dew or frost reveals webs that are nearly invisible at other times. Some adult spiders do not live past the fall season, while others overwinter under bark, in leaf litter or in other shelters. Yet some spiders can be observed year-round. Yellow sac spiders (Cheiracanthium mildei), longbodied cellar spiders (Pholcus phalangioides) and others share our homes, egg cases can be found on buildings and vegetation, and thinlegged wolf spiders (Pardosa spp.) may take advantage of a sunny, mild winter day to catch some rays on a stump or log.
                
                Researchers have discovered astonishingly high densities of spiders in certain habitats. For example, a British researcher once estimated a total of about 5.5 million spiders in a productive hectare of meadow.
                
                These myriad of spiders are quite diverse. Closer to home, more than 800 species, representing 35 families, have been found in our province, and these numbers continue to grow as new spiders are reported.
                
                Spiders can be daunting to identify. The colour of a species is often quite variable even when mature, while immature spiders are often very different than adults. Males and females of the same species may be similar or quite different in coloration and size. Males are slightly or much smaller than females. The pedipalps of the males resemble boxing gloves (for transferring sperm).
                
                Learning family characteristics helps greatly. Among web-weavers, the type or location of web often distinguishes the family. Families can also be identified by the arrangement of the spider’s eyes. Some species are so distinctly marked that identification in the field is easy.
                
                The following guide, of course, is not comprehensive. Instead, an effort has been made to choose species and families to represent the following: first, commonly observed spiders; second, distinctive and dramatic species; and third, examples of some unusual families that make our arachnofauna so diverse and interesting.
